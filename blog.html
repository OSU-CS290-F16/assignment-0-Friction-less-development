    <h2>Ben's simplistic blog<h2>
    <h4>Ben reflects about making blog systems <sub>September 22, 2016</sub></h4>
    </p>Soo nothing really to this assignment, but that's just me.
    It would probably be a good starting point if you were really new at github/html.<br>
    I made a blogging system once. It let you create a blog, had a markdown editor
    for the page (From an external package, but I did edit it to have youtube embed and
    the ability to upload images to the server that would add them to your blog).<br>
    Also had sharing abilities with people in the app,
    but won't go too in depth cuz there was an NDA. Interesting thing though was that I only used one
    template for pretty much every instance a blog showed up, whether it was in a news feed, embedded
    somewhere else, a single post showing comments, or anything. Not saying that's optimal per se,
    but the entire contents of the blog was only about 5 html pages because of it.
    <br>One thing I'm mising though. Is if I wanted to make that again from scratch,
    I might have some problems..or not. The main thing I'm wondering about is how to initially
    set up a routing system. Potentially it couldn't be too difficult. The other thing I'm wondering
    about is website-wide headers, security policies, and SEO. All that basic stuff you gotta get set
    up before you start working on the actual thing.
    <br><br><strong>Update:</strong> This inspired me to boot up meteorjs and get a website working again. It worked but I don't really have an idea for a website atm.
